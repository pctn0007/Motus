Motus is a Student Project that is designed to be an Active Remote Security System that can be placed within a car, a boat, in your purse, even your purse inside your prius! Or etc. This device is designed to alert the owner of their certain vehicle or valuable items / objects of any individual altering its movement, position or if someone is inside it or manipulating it in general.
